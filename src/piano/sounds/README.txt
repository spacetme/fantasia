Zenph Studios Yamaha Disklavier Pro Piano Multisamples for OLPC:

  A collection of Grand Piano samples played by a Yamaha Disklavier
  Pro. Performed by computer and specifically recorded for OLPC by
  Dr. Mikhail Krishtal, Director of Music Research and Production, and
  his team at Zenph Studios. They are included in the OLPC sound
  sample library.

  How is it being done: "The Disklavier Pro has an internal
  electronically-controlled mechanism that allows it to play sounds
  with very precise specifications. It has its own file format known
  as XP MIDI, an extension of standard midi. I [Mikhail Krishtal]
  prepare the files for it to play -- in this case, representing notes
  of different registers, durations, and dynamic levels."

  studio location is in Raleigh, North Carolina.
